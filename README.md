EVO
===
A startup open source colony simulator game.

The goal is to make EVO a game which starts out as a number of stranded people
on an island of sorts, the goal is to have them survive by making the right
desicions. They will have to start cultivating food to remain fed, and find a way
to remain hydrated. So designate a piece of island as a farm, and your peons
will start to cultivate some... potatoes?

The setting should be post apocalyptic. There could be radioactive storms,
weird animals and random debris that washes up on the shores of this island.

Feel free to contact me and to contribute!
